# TrouveTonArtisan

The aim of this project is to develop a website for the Auvergne Rh√¥ne-Alpes region to facilitate the meeting between private customers and craftsman in this region. Private customers can make a filtered research by selecting a service category or/and by entering text.
When they found their craftsman, they can contact him by mail using a form on our website.

This project uses external technologies like :
- TailwindCSS for the style,
- FontAwesome for icons,
- EmailJS to send mails to craftsman and private customers (auto-reply),
- Sentry to report errors.
